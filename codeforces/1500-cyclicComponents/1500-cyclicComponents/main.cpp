     to detect a connected component, we will simply group all vertices found in a dfs, if during the dfs, a vertex is visited more than once, the edges of all vertices in the connected component must have been visited-if this is true, we have a cycle. So, one simple way to check this is to make sure that each vertex has a degree of 2. The found vertices will be ignored when searching for further connected components
     
        start at a vertex, if the vertex has been visited, move to the next available component. Otherwise, if it has more than one neighbor or 0 neighbors, mark the connected component a non-cycle. Remove the vertex from the graph by setting the corresponding column and row to false. Continue the DFS.
