/* Optional: LeetCode #547: "Friend Circles"
 * (https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-circles/)
 * There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, 
 * while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. 
 * For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, 
 * then A is an indirect friend of C. We define a friend circle as a 
 * group of students who are direct or indirect friends.
 *
 * You are given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between 
 * students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are 
 * direct friends with each other, otherwise they are not.
 * 
 * TODO: output the total number of friend circles among all the students. */
