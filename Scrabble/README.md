For this project, I used C++ to create a scrabble game and AI!

This scrabble game can be configured to work with multiple configurations and dictionaries.

Please read Input/example.txt for examples of valid moves. The valid moves are pass, exchange, and place. Place must be followed by either | or - to indicate orientation. To start the program, please be sure to indicate the directory of the config folder as an argument.

I have only included the source code for the Scrabble AI. This AI is based on a paper by Appel and Jacobson. The AI implements a backtracking approach to calculate the optimum word to place. It can be very difficult to beat!

Good Luck
